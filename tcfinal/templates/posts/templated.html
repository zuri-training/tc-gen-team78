                      from the actual delivery packaging for the Goods. The client
                      acknowledges that the Goods are unique, rare and of high value and that
                      the value of the Goods can be reduced by merely handling the Goods.
                      <b> {{ q.Your_Website_Name }}</b> will make its best effort to deliver the Goods by the
                      agreed date or within a reasonable time if no dates are stated. All
                      delivery dates are estimates only and time of delivery is not of the

                      all complaints as to defects are waived. Risk of loss or damage to the

                      behalf of the Buyer, delivery shall be deemed to take place on the date

                      United Kingdom, the Buyer understands that should they wish to import
                      the Goods into the European Union they are liable for any import taxes /
                      VAT chargeable by any customs authority for the importation of the Goods
                      into any member country of the European Union.

                      If the Buyer is contracting as a consumer and has entered into a
                      contract for the sale of Goods with <b> {{ q.Your_Website_Name }}</b> by distance selling
                      means (for example, via the telephone, by mail order or online), the
                      Buyer has a statutory right to cancel for any reason and receive a full
                      refund. The Buyer will receive a full refund of the price paid for the
                      Goods in accordance with 508 Gallery refunds policy (set out below). The
                      Buyer’s statutory right to cancel a contract starts from the date of the
                      written invoice issued by 508 Gallery pursuant to clause 2.2 (when the
                      contract between <b> {{ q.Your_Website_Name }}</b> and the Buyer is formed). If the Goods
                      have been delivered to the Buyer, the Buyer may cancel at any time
                      within seven working days, starting from the day after the Buyer
                      receives the Goods. If the Buyer is contracting as a consumer and has
                      cancelled the contract between it and <b> {{ q.Your_Website_Name }}</b> within the
                      seven-day cooling-off period (see clause 6.1 above), <b> {{ q.Your_Website_Name }}</b> will
                      process the refund due to the Buyer as soon as possible and, in any
                      case, within 30 days of the day on which the Buyer gave <b> {{ q.Your_Website_Name }}</b>
                      notice of cancellation. In this case, <b> {{ q.Your_Website_Name }}</b> will refund the
                      price of the Goods in full (except in the case of sealed Goods as
                      described in clause 6.4), and any applicable delivery charges. However,
                      the Buyer will be responsible for the cost of returning the item to
                      <b> {{ q.Your_Website_Name }}</b>. In all other cases not covered by clause 6.1, the Buyer
                      may return any Goods delivered at the Buyer’s cost within 7 days of
                      receipt by giving written notification (by registered post, confirmed
                      fax or confirmed email) of intent to return to <b> {{ q.Your_Website_Name }}</b>. If the
                      Buyer decides to return the Goods, the Goods must be returned and
                      received by <b> {{ q.Your_Website_Name }}</b> within 7 days of receipt of confirmed notice
                      of return from the Buyer. If the Goods are not received within 7 days of
                      receipt of confirmed notice of return from the Buyer, the sale is deemed
                      final and no returns of the Goods will be accepted. With the Goods, the
                      Buyer acknowledges that the Goods are unique, rare and of high value and
                      that handling of said Goods can reduce the value of the Goods. Once a
                      sale is deemed final, no returns will be accepted and the Client hereby
                      accepts and waives any claims he/she may have under English law or
                      otherwise. The Buyer is responsible for all delivery costs and insurance
                      costs incurred for returned Goods. Unless otherwise prohibited by law,
                      full reimbursement of the purchase price of the Goods, less insurance
                      and delivery costs, shall be the Buyer’s sole remedy if the Goods are
                      returned for any reason whatsoever.
