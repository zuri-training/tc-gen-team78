      <h2>TERMS OF SALE</h2>
      <p>
        Terms of Sale By placing an order you are offering to purchase a product
        on and subject to the following terms and conditions. All orders are
        subject to availability and confirmation of the order price. Dispatch
        times may vary according to availability and subject to any delays
        resulting from postal delays or force majeure for which we will not be
        responsible. In order to contract with [COMPANY URL] you must be over 18
        years of age and possess a valid credit or debit card issued by a bank
        acceptable to us. [[COMPANY URL] retains the right to refuse any request
        made by you. If your order is accepted we will inform you by email and
        we will confirm the identity of the party which you have contracted
        with. This will usually be [COMPANY URL] or may in some cases be a third
        party. Where a contract is made with a third party [COMPANY URL] is not
        acting as either agent or principal and the contract is made between
        yourself and that third party and will be subject to the terms of sale
        which they supply you. When placing an order you undertake that all
        details you provide to us are true and accurate, that you are an
        authorized user of the credit or debit card used to place your order and
        that there are sufficient funds to cover the cost of the goods. The cost
        of foreign products and services may fluctuate. All prices advertised
        are subject to such changes.

        When you place an order, you will receive an acknowledgement e-mail
        confirming receipt of your order: this email will only be an
        acknowledgement and will not constitute acceptance of your order. A
        contract between us will not be formed until we send you confirmation by
        e-mail that the goods which you ordered have been dispatched to you.
        Only those goods listed in the confirmation e-mail sent at the time of

        received. The monies received upon the debiting of your card shall be
        treated as a deposit against the value of the goods you wish to
        purchase. Once the goods have been despatched and you have been sent a
