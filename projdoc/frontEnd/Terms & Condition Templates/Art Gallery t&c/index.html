    <div class="introduction">
      <h2>INTRODUCTON</h2>
      <p class="intro-paragraph">
        These Terms and Conditions govern your relationship with “[COMPANY
        NAME]” and apply to all quotations, offers, orders and contracts for
        sale of Goods. Please ensure that you read these Terms and Conditions
        carefully, and check that the details on any quotation, offer, order or
        contract and in these Terms and Conditions are complete and accurate. If
        you think that there is a mistake, please contact [COMPANY NAME] to
        discuss, and please make sure that you ask us to confirm any changes in
        writing to avoid any confusion.
      </p>
      <p>In these Terms and Conditions, unless stated otherwise:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Buyer means the purchaser of the Goods from [COMPANY NAME];</li>
        <li>[COMPANY NAME] means the company selling the Goods</li>
        <li>
          Goods means the items to be sold to the Buyer by [COMPANY NAME],
          either all or part of them as set out in the written invoice issued by
          [COMPANY NAME] pursuant to clause 2.2
        </li>
        <li>
          Terms and Conditions means the terms and conditions set out in this
          document.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="intro-paragraph">
        The Terms and Conditions constitute the entire understanding of the
        parties and supersede all prior discussions, negotiations, agreements
        and understandings, whether oral or written. No change or modification
        of the Terms and Conditions (including change orders) is valid unlessit
        is IN WRITING AND SIGNED BY ALL THE PARTIES. If any part of the Terms
        and Conditions is held invalid, unenforceable or void by a court of
        competent jurisdiction, the Terms and Conditions are considered
        divisible as to such part, and the remainder of the Terms and Conditions
        are valid and binding as though such part was not included in the Terms
        and Conditions to the fullest extent permitted by law. The Terms and
        Conditions are governed by the laws (without regard to the laws that
        might be applicable under principles of conflicts of law) as to all
        matters, including, but not limited to, matters of validity,
        construction, effect and performance and both parties agree to the
        exclusive jurisdiction of the court. The Terms and Conditions may be
        executed in two or more parts, each of which shall be deemed an original
        but all of which together shall be one and the same instrument. Nothing
        in these Terms and Conditions affects the statutory rights of any
        consumer. If [COMPANY NAME] fails, at any time while these Terms and
        Conditions are in force, to insist that the Buyer performs any of its
        obligations under these Terms and Conditions, or if [COMPANY NAME] does
        not exercise any of its rights or remedies under these Terms and
        Conditions, that will not mean that [COMPANY NAME] has waived such
        rights or remedies and will not mean that the Buyer does not have to
        comply with those obligations. If [COMPANY NAME] does waive a default by
        the Buyer, that will not mean that it will automatically waive any
        subsequent default by the Buyer. No waiver by [COMPANY NAME] of any of
        these Terms and Conditions shall be effective unless it expressly says
        that it is a waiver and it tells the Buyer so in writing. A person who
        is not party to these Terms and Conditions shall not have any rights
        under or in connection with them under the Contracts (Rights of Third
        Parties) Act 1999.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="order">
      <h2>ORDER</h2>
      <p>
        Any offer or acceptance of a quotation made by the Buyer will be deemed
        an offer to purchase the Goods governed by these Terms and Conditions.
        No offer or acceptance of a quotation will be deemed a binding agreement
        of sale until confirmation with a written invoice has been issued by
        [COMPANY NAME]. Upon confirmation, these Terms and Conditions (as they
        may be amended by [COMPANY NAME] from time to time) form a binding
        agreement between the Buyer and [COMPANY NAME]. Any Goods or services
        not confirmed by written invoice issued by [COMPANY NAME] are deemed
        additional work and must be agreed in writing signed by both parties.
        These Terms and Conditions are applicable to any additional work or
        additional sales to the Buyer by [COMPANY NAME].
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="purchase-price">
      <h2>PURCHASE PRICE AND PAYMENT METHODS</h2>
      <p>
        The purchase price shall be the price offered by [COMPANY NAME] and
        confirmed to the Buyer by written invoice issued by [COMPANY NAME]. The
        purchase price includes the cost of VAT, sale, use, excise or similar
        duty which may be applied. Any packaging, delivery costs, fees, duty or
        taxes applied will be billed to and paid by the Buyer as set forth on
        the written invoice issued by [COMPANY NAME]. All payment shall be made
        in agreed currency and the agreed price is due in full at the time the
        offered price is accepted and confirmed by invoice, unless agreed
        otherwise in writing. The Buyer will have 10 working days from the date
        of invoice to make payment in full, unless agreed otherwise. Ownership
        (legal title) of the product will not pass to Buyer until the accepted
        and confirmed price is paid in full by the Buyer and received by
        [COMPANY NAME] in cleared funds. Late Fees. Any payment not paid in full
        as per the Terms and Conditions will be subject to interest assessed on
        funds due at 3 percent per annum over the Royal Bank of Scotland base
        rate from time to time
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="goods">
      <h2>GOODS</h2>
      <p>
        The Goods to be delivered shall be specifically described in the written
        invoice provided by [COMPANY NAME]. In the event the specific Good is
        not available as of the date the order is confirmed by written invoice,
        [COMPANY NAME] agrees to source Goods of similar or greater quality. In
        the event [COMPANY NAME] cannot source Goods acceptable to the Buyer
        because the ordered Goods are not available, the Buyer will have 7 days
        to provide written notice to cancel the order. [COMPANY NAME] will, upon
        receipt of such notice, refund moneys paid in full. The Buyer agrees and
        acknowledges that all specifications and advertising issued by [COMPANY
        NAME] and any descriptions or illustrations contained in [COMPANY NAME]
        marketing materials are provided for the sole purpose of giving an
        approximate idea of the Goods described in them. [COMPANY NAME] is not
        bound by such descriptions which do not form a part of these Terms and
        Conditions, nor are they a part of the sales agreement and this is not a
        sale by sample.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="product-delivery">
      <h2>PRODUCT DELIVERY</h2>
      <p>
        Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, delivery of the Goods shall be
        to the Buyer’s home or business address. The Goods may be delivered
        framed or unframed. The frame will encase the product and is separate
        from the actual delivery packaging for the Goods. The client
        acknowledges that the Goods are unique, rare and of high value and that
        the value of the Goods can be reduced by merely handling the Goods.
        [COMPANY NAME] will make its best effort to deliver the Goods by the
        agreed date or within a reasonable time if no dates are stated. All
        delivery dates are estimates only and time of delivery is not of the
        essence. The Buyer must inspect the Goods upon delivery and advise
        [COMPANY NAME] of any defects within 10 working days of delivery date or
        all complaints as to defects are waived. Risk of loss or damage to the
        Goods passes to the Buyer upon delivery. Where the Buyer requests that
        the Goods be placed directly in the safe custody of another party on
        behalf of the Buyer, delivery shall be deemed to take place on the date
        the Goods are transferred into safe custody. Where the Buyer requests at
        the time of purchase, that the Goods are stored “In Bond” outside of the
        United Kingdom, the Buyer understands that should they wish to import
        the Goods into the European Union they are liable for any import taxes /
        VAT chargeable by any customs authority for the importation of the Goods
        into any member country of the European Union.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="returns">
      <h2>RETURNS</h2>
      <p>
        If the Buyer is contracting as a consumer and has entered into a
        contract for the sale of Goods with [COMPANY NAME] by distance selling
        means (for example, via the telephone, by mail order or online), the
        Buyer has a statutory right to cancel for any reason and receive a full
        refund. The Buyer will receive a full refund of the price paid for the
        Goods in accordance with 508 Gallery refunds policy (set out below). The
        Buyer’s statutory right to cancel a contract starts from the date of the
        written invoice issued by 508 Gallery pursuant to clause 2.2 (when the
        contract between [COMPANY NAME] and the Buyer is formed). If the Goods
        have been delivered to the Buyer, the Buyer may cancel at any time
        within seven working days, starting from the day after the Buyer
        receives the Goods. If the Buyer is contracting as a consumer and has
        cancelled the contract between it and [COMPANY NAME] within the
        seven-day cooling-off period (see clause 6.1 above), [COMPANY NAME] will
        process the refund due to the Buyer as soon as possible and, in any
        case, within 30 days of the day on which the Buyer gave [COMPANY NAME]
        notice of cancellation. In this case, [COMPANY NAME] will refund the
        price of the Goods in full (except in the case of sealed Goods as
        described in clause 6.4), and any applicable delivery charges. However,
        the Buyer will be responsible for the cost of returning the item to
        [COMPANY NAME]. In all other cases not covered by clause 6.1, the Buyer
        may return any Goods delivered at the Buyer’s cost within 7 days of
        receipt by giving written notification (by registered post, confirmed
        fax or confirmed email) of intent to return to [COMPANY NAME]. If the
        Buyer decides to return the Goods, the Goods must be returned and
        received by [COMPANY NAME] within 7 days of receipt of confirmed notice
        of return from the Buyer. If the Goods are not received within 7 days of
        receipt of confirmed notice of return from the Buyer, the sale is deemed
        final and no returns of the Goods will be accepted. With the Goods, the
        Buyer acknowledges that the Goods are unique, rare and of high value and
        that handling of said Goods can reduce the value of the Goods. Once a
        sale is deemed final, no returns will be accepted and the Client hereby
        accepts and waives any claims he/she may have under English law or
        otherwise. The Buyer is responsible for all delivery costs and insurance
        costs incurred for returned Goods. Unless otherwise prohibited by law,
        full reimbursement of the purchase price of the Goods, less insurance
        and delivery costs, shall be the Buyer’s sole remedy if the Goods are
        returned for any reason whatsoever.

    <div class="warranties">
      <h2>WARRANTIES</h2>
      <p>

        specifically stated herein. Such warranties are in lieu of all other

    </div>
    <div class="termination">
      <h2>TERMINATION</h2>
      <p>
        [COMPANY NAME] may terminate this agreement if the Buyer fails to make
        payment when due or substantially breaches any other obligation of these
        Terms and Conditions. [COMPANY NAME] may notify the Buyer in writing of
        such termination and recover from the Buyer payment for Goods sold or
        work completed. The Buyer is liable for any and all costs incurred by
        [COMPANY NAME] in connection with collection of such unpaid funds. Force
        Majeure Provision of Goods supplied to the Buyer covered by the Sales
        Agreement is contingent upon the non-occurrence of strikes, accidents,
        delays of carriers, delays of delivery, delay of personnel or other
        causes unavoidable or beyond the control of [COMPANY NAME]. If
        performance of the Sales Agreement or any obligation under the Sales
        Agreement is prevented, restricted, or interfered with by causes beyond
        either party’s reasonable control (“force majeure”), and if the party
        unable to carry out its obligations gives the other party prompt written
        notice of such event, then the obligations of the party invoking this
        provision shall be suspended to the extent necessary by such event. The
        term Force Majeure shall include, without limitation, acts of God, fire,
        explosion, vandalism, storm or other similar occurrence, orders or acts
        of military or civil authority, or by national emergencies,
        insurrections, riots, wars, supplier failures, shortages, breach, or
        delays. The excused party shall use reasonable efforts under the
        circumstances to avoid or remove such causes of non- performance and
        shall proceed to perform with reasonable dispatch whenever such causes
        are removed or ceased. An act or omission shall be deemed within the
        reasonable control of a party if committed, omitted, or caused by such
        party, or its employees, officers, agents, or affiliates.

    <div class="mediation">
      <h2>MEDIATION AND ARBITRATION</h2>
      <p>
        Any disputes between the parties hereto, whether arising under these
        Terms and Conditions or under any written invoices issued by [COMPANY
        NAME] or otherwise, which the parties cannot resolve between themselves
        using good faith shall be referred to a court certified mediator in the
        County of the principal office of [COMPANY NAME], and any mediation
        shall be held in the County of the principal office of [COMPANY NAME].
        The Buyer shall bear the cost of said mediation. In the event that said
        dispute is not resolved in mediation, the parties shall submit the
        dispute to a neutral arbitrator residing in the County of the principal
        address of [COMPANY NAME]. The arbitration shall be held in the County
        of the principal office of [COMPANY NAME]. If either party refuses to
        comply with a ruling or decision of the arbitrator and a lawsuit is
        brought to enforce said ruling or decision, it is agreed that the party
        not complying with the ruling or decision of the arbitrator shall pay
        all the court costs and reasonable legal fees incurred in enforcing the
        ruling or decision of the arbitrator. Any rights of injunctive relief
        shall be in addition to and not in derogation or limitation of any other
        legal rights

    </div>
    <div class="indemnity">
      <h2>INDEMNITY</h2>
      <p>
        The Buyer hereby agrees to indemnify [COMPANY NAME] and undertakes to
        keep [COMPANY NAME] indemnified against any losses, damages, costs,
        liabilities and expenses (including without limitation legal expenses
        and any amounts paid by [COMPANY NAME] to a third party in settlement of
        a claim or dispute on the advice of its legal advisers) incurred or
        suffered arising out of any breach by Buyer of any provision of these
        Terms and Conditions or arising out of any claim that Buyer has breached

    <div class="liability">
      <h2>LIABILITY</h2>
      <p>
        If [COMPANY NAME] fails to comply with these Terms and Conditions, it
        will be responsible for loss or damage that the Buyer suffers which is a
        foreseeable result of [COMPANY NAME]’s breach of the Terms and
        Conditions or its negligence, but it is not responsible for:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>any loss or damage that is not foreseeable;</li>

          any business losses, or losses to parties who are not consumers.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Loss or damage is foreseeable if they were an obvious consequence of
        [COMPANY NAME]’s breach or if they were contemplated by both parties at
        the time the contract is entered into. Nothing in these Terms shall
        limit or exclude [COMPANY NAME] liability for death or personal injury
        resulting from its negligence; defective products under the Consumer
        Protection Act 1987; for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation, breach

        [COMPANY NAME] in respect of breach of any contract for the sale of
        Goods or any representation given in connection with such a contract,

        (“The Client”) desires to sell a piece of Art Work, previously acquired
        from one of [COMPANY NAME]’s joint venture partners and the client has
        received a legitimate offer in writing from an unaffiliated third party

        from the client. (b) If the Company gives the client notice that it
        desires to purchase such Art Work, then payment for the Art Work shall
        be by cheque or bank transfer, against delivery of the Art Work to be
